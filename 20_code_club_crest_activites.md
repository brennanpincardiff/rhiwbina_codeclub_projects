## Possible CREST activities

Key point here is to do the work yourself and to share your work with Paul or Gareth as this makes us happy and we can give you a sticker for your SuperStar passport. 

As a starting point we recommend completing a [Code Club Scratch worksheet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub/scratch-module-1) to see how you get on. 

We think these will make good exercises. 
We recommend discussing these with others and sharing your work if you want recognition. 
* Make and customize a Scratch game like [Dodgeball](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dodgeball)
* Explore making a multi-level Scratch game like [Make Your Own World](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/create-your-own-world)
* Make a [micro-bit animation](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/animated-animals/) (and learn about microcontrollers)
* Try some Minecraft programming
* Do python [turtle shapes](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/rhiwbina_codeclub_projects/blob/master/python_shapes.md) and [colours](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/rhiwbina_codeclub_projects/blob/master/python_shapes_colours.md) and adapt to show you understand	
* Try the python [Modern Art](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/modern-art) worksheet and customize
* Explore the Python [Secret Messages](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secret-messages) worksheet and ecode a message for someone to solve
* You can consider other Code Club Scratch or Python worksheets. 

Physical computer and electronics is good too:
* Use a [microbit to control a robot](https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=2068)
* Make an electrical circuit to turn on a light (different switches)
* Make an electrical circuit to control a motor (different kinds of motors)

We are looking to develop other activites:
* Learning and demonstrating some javascript  
* Codebreaking worksheet and puzzles

There are also lots of [CREST SuperStar activities](https://primarylibrary.crestawards.org/). 
These ones look interesting
* Try the Fingerprints SuperStar activity
* Try the Plastics SuperStar activity
* Try the Tea SuperStar activity 
Maybe check the SuperStar activity sheets – suggest some you would like to do or maybe do some at home with your parents – document and share your results.
