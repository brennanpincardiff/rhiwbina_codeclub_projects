## Rhiwbina Library Code Club invites you to work towards a CREST Award.
[CREST](https://www.crestawards.org/what-is-crest) is a scheme to inspire young people to think and behave like scientists and engineers. 
In the first instance, we are encouraging learners to consider working towards a (CREST Super Star award)[https://www.crestawards.org/crest-superstar]. 
This involves engaging in a series of <b>eight one hour tasks</b> when you attend Code Club. It is entirely voluntary.
We hope it will be fun. 

Here are some suggested activities:
* Make a Scratch game  (maybe try Ghostbusters - [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/ghostbusters])
* Extend your Scratch experience with a multilevel game (how about: Create your own World - [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/create-your-own-world])
* Write a Python programme (try Turtle Race (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race) or Modern Art (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/modern-art)
* Control a Microbit (https://microbit.org/code/) 
* Make an electronic circuit and explain the parts (talk with Gareth - he can help...)
* Make and/or control a robot (we have a 4tronix MiniBit you can try: [https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=2068])
* Create a web page - perhaps list your CREST Super Star Activities (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/project-showcase)
* Make a data visualisation with Python (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/popular-pets)
* Gather some of your own data and analyse it (maybe you & an adults sleep or eating?)
* Make some DNA and explain what it is (please ask in advance and we can organise this)
* Use a microscope to explore mini-beasts, plants, or cells. 
* Make and edit a simple movie 

Lots of other options are available. CREST have a library of resouces which cover a broad range of activities (https://primarylibrary.crestawards.org/#SuperStar). 
Check out the resources and tell us if there is a particular task you would like to try.

Follow the sheets and have fun customising your work in any way you want:-)

If you want to get involved tell one of the Code Club leaders. 
When you complete a task, tell us before you go home. Try to share and document your work.

Tell us, each time, before you go home what you have done. We will record your activity as you move towards your goal.
