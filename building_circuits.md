## Have a play with some of the electronics to Build your first circuit…

### Electronic packs should contain
- Breadboard
- Battery packs
- Light emitting diodes (LEDs)
- Press switch
- Resistors - two kins
- Wires for connecting

### Other possible components
- Photo sensitive resistor
- Slide switch
- Motors

### Step 1: Your first cicuit
Use:
- Battery
- Resistor
- Light emitting diode (LED)
- Some wires to connect things

Use clips to connect the batteries to the breadboard 
Place the resistor in line and then the LED
Can you get the light glowing?

Without resistor, LED will burn out…

LED have directions - one long wire and one short wire. The longer leg is the positive side of the LED, called the “anode,” and the shorter leg is the negative side, called the “cathode.” 
It only works one way - turn it around if there is not light

Check all your connections and remember how the channels of the breadboard connect.

### Step 2: Add a switch

Add a switch – two kinds to try: press switch or slide switch

What is the difference?

Why might one be useful…

### Step 3: Try different sized resistors

Higher resistor – lower amount of light… 

Because resistors restrict the amount of electricity. 

### Step 4: Try Light sensitive resistor
What happens when you put your finger over the socket. 

These kind of sensors control our street lights. 

What other things would you like to try?

Snap Circuits may be available to play with…
