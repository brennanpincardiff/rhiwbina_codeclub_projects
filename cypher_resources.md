# Welcome to Code Club. 
## Here I want to gather some resources about cypher and cyber security. 

A good place to start is the python project on the Caeser cypher

Check this out here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secret-messages/2

This describes one of the first substution cyphers in history and is really good fundamental knowledge. 


For puzzles and games (good learning and a bit of fun):
- https://cybergamesuk.com/ 
- Try free puzzles on this page: https://play.cyberstart.com/ (requires registration and futher levels requrie payment)

For some of the theory about cyphers, here is a free educational link from Khan Academy:
- https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography




Future material
- Two rail cipher
- Twisted path cipher
- Pig Pen cipher
- Binary 
- Hex
- Find the puzzle hidden in a web page
- Another ROT cipher
- Hidden words
- Dots on page
- Hidden letters with the foldsâ€¦ 
- One time pad

Maybe a bit about modular maths and maths functions...
