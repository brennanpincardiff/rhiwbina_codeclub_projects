## Rhiwbina Library Code Club Minecraft Education Path.

We are very happy to support learners exploring Minecraft Education. We hope our learners have fun. 

Learners need to open Minecraft Education and access it with their school Hwb logins. 

It's OK to play for a little while but as this is Code Club we recommend that they also try coding... 

Try some of the starting tutorials (you can use blocks, Python or JavaScript):
* Chicken Rain tutorial is good fun and a great place to start. 
  - Try changing the number of chickens that is created
  - Try making other animals
  - Press the home symbol to go back to the tutorial list
* Flower Train tutorial is quite simple:
  - edit the flowers you are placing...  
  - if you did it with blocks, what does the code look like in Python?
* Lava Tower tutorial is fun too
  - Have a play and change what you like... 
* TNT blocks are fun but can be a little dangerous
  - you can use lava to light the TNT... 

* Trying [coding a house with Python](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/rhiwbina_codeclub_projects/blob/master/minecraft_edu_house.md) or
[multiple houses](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/rhiwbina_codeclub_projects/blob/master/minecraft_edu_make_a_village.md) and try to make a village. 

* There are lots of other interesting resources. Here is a list. 

Tell us what you've done and have fun...
