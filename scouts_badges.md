# Collaboration between Rhiwbina Library Code Club and 2nd Rhiwbina Scouts
## Aim for the Digital Maker Staged Activity Badge Stage 2 
(https://www.scouts.org.uk/staged-badges/digital-maker/stage-2)

Scouts can do the activities in groups with three on each computer. Each station will take about 30 minutes or so. 

### Station 1: Create a piece of interactive or animated digital art using software.
We plan to do this activity with the scouts using their own smart phones: https://www.scouts.org.uk/activities/pixel-art-bugs/
The scouts have to create the best bug they can and try to animate it. 
Facilitators should practice so that they can provide some guidance. 

### Station 2: Create a simple computer program to help with a scouting activity, and try it out.
We can do this with Scratch or with python. 
The Scratch project that does that will be flying hippos. It'll be a simpler version of this:https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/clone-wars/4

The python version will be something like this: https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/rhiwbina_codeclub_projects/blob/master/python_shapes.md

To make this work we will need some computers that can run Scratch off line (we can download it) or python offline. 
([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is free to students and has a community version too). 

This activity is not described on the Scout site but has been delivered to learners in Code Club with success. . 
The scouts will be coding and hopefully learn about at least one programming control structure in either Scratch or python. 
We'll need at least three computers for this. Three computers, three scouts on each. A station for 9 scouts.  

### Station 3: Make a simple digital creation that uses code to interact with the wider world through inputs (such as buttons or typing on a keyboard) and outputs (such as a computer screen, sound, or lights).
For this we will use microbits and we should try this activity: https://www.scouts.org.uk/activities/swing-it-shake-it-move-it-make-it/.
We'll need three computers with the code interface for the microbits downloaded on them and about 6 microbits.
Then the scouts can play the game and compete a bit... also fulfills the a scout activity requirement (see activity 2 above).

#### Kit Requirements
- Scouts smartphones with a pixel art app downloaded. PixilArt seems like a good option. 
- 6 computers - three for station 2 and three for station 3 but the more the better. 
- Three computers with a python IDE downloaded on them.
- Three computers with the software for using microbits downloaded on them
- Or some kind of wifi or hotspot
- Microbits: perhaps 6, three for programming and another three set up for the scouts to play with. 
- Print outs of the exercises.

Additional options: bring along a Raspberry Pi or other kit for scouts to play with including some circuit building materials. This can be a fourth table. 

#### Message to scouts ahead of time
This week we will be running a session in collaboration with Rhiwbina Library Code Club. 
We are aiming for the Digital Maker Staged Activity Badge Stage 2 sponsored by Raspberry Pi. 

One of the activities will involve making pixel art with the scouts' smart phones. Please see if the scouts can download PixilArt onto their phone. The app is free.
The challenge is to make a bug animation. Scouts can play with the app ahead of time to do this if they want. 

If scouts have access to a lap top and want to bring it, this would be helpful. They can download software for using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) or python ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is free to students)
