# Welcome to Code Club. 
## Today we are going to try learing a bit about Github 

Github is a version control system. It allows you to collaborate making code. 
In this project, please try to improve the Rhiwbina Libary Code Club website on Github. 

We will use the browser today but you can set up your IDE with Github too. 

Please start off by creating an account for yourself on Github by going to [Join Github](https://github.com/join).
Make sure you remember your login and password. 

Then go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/Rhiwbina-Library-Code-Club/rhiwbinalibcodeclub.github.io) for Rhiwbina Library Code Club webpage.

Look at the repo and find the Fork button. Select this button and fork this repo into yourown area on Github. 

Make changes to the Markdown file or add code on a separate file. Some information on [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
Preview the pages. 

When you are happy, commit the changes to this file. Commit requires you to add a comment about the changes you've made. 

Repeat the editing and commit process until you have made some changes that you are happy with. 

Consider adding a page with some of your own code to showcase your work. I think these can be in html or markdown.

Add a link to the front page so that users can find your page.

Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to ask me (Paul) to pull the changes onto the Rhiwbina Library Code Club site. 

You might benefit from reading this [Introduction to Github](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)

Also this [Khan Academy page](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/hosting-your-website-on-github#:~:text=Code%20repositories%20can%20contain%20all,at%20yourusername.github.io%20.) might help.
