# Welcome to Code Club. 
## Today we are going to try learing a bit about Github 

Github is a version control system. It allows you to collaborate making code. 
In this project, please try to improve the Rhiwbina Libary Code Club website on Github. 

We will use the browser today but you can set up your IDE with Github too. 

Please start off by creating an account for yourself on Github by going to [Join Github](https://github.com/join).
Make sure you remember your login and password. 

Then go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/Rhiwbina-Library-Code-Club/rhiwbinalibcodeclub.github.io) for Rhiwbina Library Code Club webpage.

Using the big green button fork this repository. 

Make changes to the Markdown file or add code on a separate file. Some information on [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 

Commit the changes to this file. 

Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to ask me (Paul) to pull the changes onto the Rhiwbina Library Code Club site. 

Consider adding a page with some of your own code to showcase your work. I think these can be in html or markdown.  

Add a link to the front page so that users can find your page.
